In the algorithm we start with a partition where each node is in its own part. Then in each step, we randomly select a hyperedge. Subsequently, we consider merging each set of that parts it touches. We actually merge the parts if the new best modularity is at least as high as the modularity from the previous step.\n\nReturns a NamedTuple where the field bp contains partition and the field bm contains the modularity value for that partition, finally, the fiel mod_history represents modularities achieved in subsequent steps of the algorithm.\n\nFor more information see Algorithm 1 at: Clustering via Hypergraph Modularity (submitted to Plos ONE), authors: Bogumił Kamiński, Valerie Poulin, Paweł Prałat, Przemysław Szufel, Francois Theberge\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"reference/#I/O","page":"Reference","title":"I/O","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"reference/","page":"Reference","title":"Reference","text":"hg_save\nhg_load","category":"page"},{"location":"reference/#SimpleHypergraphs.hg_save","page":"Reference","title":"SimpleHypergraphs.hg_save","text":"hg_save(io::IO, h::Hypergraph, format::HGF_Format)\n\nSaves a hypergraph h to an output stream io in hgf format.\n\n\n\n\n\nhg_save(io::IO, h::Hypergraph, format::JSON_Format)\n\nSaves a hypergraph h to an output stream io in json format.\n\nIf h has Composite Types either for vertex metadata or hyperedges metadata, the user has to explicit tell the JSON3 package about it, for instance using:\n\nJSON3.StructType(::Type{MyType}) = JSON3.Struct().\n\nSee the (JSON3.jl documentation)[https://github.com/quinnj/JSON3.jl] for more details.\n\nThe json in output contains the following information (keys):\n\nn : number of vertices\nk : number of hyperedges\nm : a matrix representation of h where rows are vertices and columns are hyperedges\nv2he : mapping vertices to hyperedges\nv_meta : vertices metadata\nhe_meta : hyperedges metadata\n\n\n\n\n\nhg_save(\n    fname::AbstractString, h::Hypergraph;\n    format::Abstract_HG_format=HGF_Format()\n)\n\nSaves a hypergraph h to a file fname in the specified format.
